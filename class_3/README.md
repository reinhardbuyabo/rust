# Modules

- Whenever you see the 2 colons, it means we're accessing sth deeply nested inside that folder.
- `mod <file>`
- `use <function>`
- Group your files into folders.
- Introduce a `mod.rs` file in the folder that hosts the modules.
- A file may be inaccessible because it was not specified in the `mod.rs`.

# Structs
- Pass in parameters as types in function signatures to restrict functionality to certain.
- We want to create functionality that is specific to User struct.
- Probably to walk, eat, and has a birthday.
